**Thoughts** 
so much FREE material out there. It's all about sorting through the bullshit. 

### Day 38: Nov 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
Scotch.io python requests - figuring out how to make simple webapps that do stuff with data I take from other places. 

**Thoughts** 
if you're trying to learn to code and not meditating you're wasting a lot of time. mindfulness helps you realize faster when you're not being present - ie learning something new. 

### Day 39: Nov 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
Scotch.io seems to be a little bit of waste of time. Moving on to attacking roadblocks in project progress analytically.

**Thoughts** 
a little stuck. 

### Day 40: Nov 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
back at django model view template basics, creating models, url paths. going through the django documentation - scouring - extracting a lot of good stuff.

### Day 48: Dec 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
special methods / dunders - init, repr, str. Class and static methods. 

**Thoughts** 
Real tired of doing tuts, need to apply more logic and design to my own projects.

**Thoughts** 
One of those days, feel dumb learning - then blam - I'll feel smart again in a day or two. push through 

### Day 52: Dec 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
started new project rango - building projects, directory, models, trying to learn how to get voting logic and more advanced DB models in place in my own projects. Gettings views and apps instatiated. Really hammering home the idea of importing each seperate module where it's needed model -> views -> urls -> templates

**Thoughts** 
rango project is cool, very detailed. 

### Day 53: Dec 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
continuing through rango project - creating url patterns. Really trying to digest and internalize how to create views and map to urls. Big realization today. No shortcuts in learning to code - literally must sit down and read, understand, internalize every intracacy via hours and exposure. Also most of the problems looking at other's code / doing tutorials is issues with materials using older versions, deprecated modules.

**Thoughts** 
just realized that a big part of my difficulties are from using different django versions - for example just realized that the url module used in some tutorials has been depricated and now paths is the common way of routing urlpatters 

### Day 54: Dec 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
Keeping on with tango rango tutorial. Implimenting models, creating admin access.

**Thoughts** 
Hmmm - not much really. Still digesting everything that goes into models, need to read more on all diff variances. 

### Day 55: Dec 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
Moving through more work with creating db models, template, views. Setting up forms - creating model forms. more work with forms.

**Thoughts** 
working with forms is similar to implimenting other models. sleepy

### Day 57: Dec 11, Wednesday

django social auths are pretty cool, still working out the kinks. 

### Day 65: Dec 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
started working on implimenting a jquery bookmarklet that captures different html elements. 

**Thoughts** 
first time working with java script with any kind of complexity. 

### Day 67: Dec 21 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
spent the last few days working on bookmarklet. mainly the jquery and html to support the Like function and main bookmarklet functionality. Javascript is cooky - need to spend more time working there seeing how the client side jQuery can do a lot of stuff.

**Thoughts** 
cool to see something simple like the bookmarklet being used for something in a project other than bookmarking. 

### Day 70: Dec 24 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
got like button working - set up intermediary model for user follow system. Building detail and list views of users.

Thinking about how functions can be imported and used within other modules and functions. 

### Day 72: Dec 26 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
stuck on implimenting Redis database - do I need this or is it depricated? I don't know. Found Fullstackpython.com that has some very good information in regards to mental models of programming abstractions. 

**Thoughts** 
looking for some interesting projects that are less web dev focused. insterested in some of the more complex functions with data.

### Day 74: Dec 28 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
started working on a Store application with products, categories, and shopping cart. forming muscle memory with starting projects, setting up apps, settings, models, views, and templates. 

**Thoughts**

### Day 75: Dec 29 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
working with django sessions to build a shopping cart.

**Today's Progress**: 
started another fresh project without using too much searching/documentation - got boostrap templates set up and models showing in templates.

**Thoughts** 
another project for the portfolio 

### Day 84: Jan 7 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Lots of work on setting up views to handle different lesson modules. Created drag and drop feature to reorganize modules and lessons within views. Used Javascript widget and AJAX for asynchronous requests to store new ordering.

**Thoughts** 
no thoughts today

### Day 92: Jan 15 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Got the webflow html, css, and js smashed in with a couple django apps - blog and simple static pages apps. still figuring out how to get images and forms synced up

**Thoughts**
