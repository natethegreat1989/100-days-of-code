### Day 1: Oct 16, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: 
Revisited "Learn Python The Hard Way" ex1-ex5. Going back over fundamentals.
Started "Learn MORE Python The Hard Way" attempting ex1-ex3. Though very difficult.
Hacked on Blog project, tried to add new button to posts.

**Thoughts** 
Feeling more confident with concepts. Still need to fully wrap head around writing tests. Need more fundamental work with HTML, CSS.

**Link(s) to work**
