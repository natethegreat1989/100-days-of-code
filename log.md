Applying new shit to projects. 

**Thoughts**

Created new project - personal portfolio. Altered some html. Having hard time setting up superuser and deploying.

**Thoughts** 
Ruby is V similar to python. Need to start committing everything to git. keep myself honest with metrics. Build the personal improvement tracker. 

Looking for easy ways to get sites deployed for free. Heroku??

### Day 34: Nov 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
More portfolio site html edits and getting heroku deployment set up. Heroku was a complete bitch, but I think I understand what it's doing a little better.

### Day 37: Nov 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
Found scotch.io and read a lot of their coursework - sorting - looking for applicable material for projects. 

**Thoughts** 
so much FREE material out there. It's all about sorting through the bullshit. 

### Day 38: Nov 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
Scotch.io python requests - figuring out how to make simple webapps that do stuff with data I take from other places. 

**Thoughts** 
if you're trying to learn to code and not meditating you're wasting a lot of time. mindfulness helps you realize faster when you're not being present - ie learning something new. 

### Day 39: Nov 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
Scotch.io seems to be a little bit of waste of time. Moving on to attacking roadblocks in project progress analytically. 
Searching for better understanding of model view template paradigm. how models import and interract. 

**Thoughts** 
a little stuck. 

### Day 40: Nov 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
back at django model view template basics, creating models, url paths. going through the django documentation - scouring - extracting a lot of good stuff.

**Thoughts** 
5th time through the docs - "ahhhaaa ok!" It's always a spelling error-dummy 

### Day 41: Nov 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
started working through blog project build out again - going through each segment and taking notes - modifying as I go along

### Day 47: Dec 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
creating updating and delete views of models - working with special decorators to modify if user that is loggedin/out sees a particular view - ie delete and update

**Thoughts** 
Though coding output has been around an hour or two a day - was good to take a little time off from many hour learning blocks - felt need to recharge the batteries. Time to get after it this week. 

### Day 48: Dec 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
special methods / dunders - init, repr, str. Class and static methods. 

**Thoughts** 
Real tired of doing tuts, need to apply more logic and design to my own projects. 


### Day 49: Dec 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Made little card deck / shuffle application studying OOP, creating classes/methods.

**Thoughts** 
still figuring out Model/view/template interactions.

### Day 51: Dec 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
Learning to design various python objects in order to build an idea from scratch. LPTHW - creating basic class and function structures using test driven development. 

**Thoughts** 
One of those days, feel dumb learning - then blam - I'll feel smart again in a day or two. push through 

### Day 52: Dec 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
started new project rango - building projects, directory, models, trying to learn how to get voting logic and more advanced DB models in place in my own projects. Gettings views and apps instatiated. Really hammering home the idea of importing each seperate module where it's needed model -> views -> urls -> templates

**Thoughts** 
rango project is cool, very detailed. 

### Day 53: Dec 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
continuing through rango project - creating url patterns. Really trying to digest and internalize how to create views and map to urls. Big realization today. No shortcuts in learning to code - literally must sit down and read, understand, internalize every intracacy via hours and exposure. Also most of the problems looking at other's code / doing tutorials is issues with materials using older versions, deprecated modules.

**Thoughts** 
just realized that a big part of my difficulties are from using different django versions - for example just realized that the url module used in some tutorials has been depricated and now paths is the common way of routing urlpatters 

### Day 54: Dec 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
Keeping on with tango rango tutorial. Implimenting models, creating admin access.

**Thoughts** 
Hmmm - not much really. Still digesting everything that goes into models, need to read more on all diff variances. 

### Day 55: Dec 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
Moving through more work with creating db models, template, views. Setting up forms - creating model forms. more work with forms.

**Thoughts** 
working with forms is similar to implimenting other models. sleepy

### Day 57: Dec 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Working on parameterized url mapping - having a hard time getting the page creation form to send input to right url routes. thinking in circles. 

**Thoughts** 
Gotta take a step back and evaluate the project and what it does as a whole. 

### Day 59: Dec 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
creating seo friendly urls with parameters, sending emails from django, adding pagination 

**Thoughts** 
difficult to get the gmail less secure apps password to work.
